Building an Structured Output for LLM with langchain,langchain.llms in Python environment

-  Author : Rahul11
- When using large language models (LLMs) in projects that require structured outputs,
  such as extracting specific fields like translations or classifications,
  challenges arise due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. For example, you might want the LLM to output a consistent schema like.

  {
  Translation: ,
  Label:  ( ),
  ...
  }
  
- However, ensuring that the model reliably adheres to this format can be difficult.
  This tutorial explores two solutions for handling structured outputs using Llama models (via Ollama) and Langchain.
  While we focus on these, the same strategies can also be applied to OpenAI models.

- In the tutorial, I present two solutions. The first involves using models trained to output JSON-structured data
  directly instead of plain text. While this approach works well, the model may occasionally produce output that doesn't fully match the required format.

- To handle these cases, the second solution uses a retry parser. This method automatically re-prompts the model
  whenever it fails to generate the correct schema, retrying until it succeeds or reaches a set limit of attempts.
